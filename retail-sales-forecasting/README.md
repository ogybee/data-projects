# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes four years of global retail sales data and builds a time-series forecast to predict sales for the next 7 days. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and category performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform EDA on historical sales data
- Identify seasonal trends and performance by region/product
- Forecast daily sales for the next 7 days from the latest date

## 📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle  
Data includes: Order Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Category, and Region

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Excel (initial exploration)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Prophet for forecasting)
- GitHub for version control and portfolio sharing

## 🔍 Key Questions
- What trends exist across regions, categories, and time?
- Are sales seasonal or cyclical?
- Can we reliably forecast short-term daily sales?

## 📊 Key Outcomes
Coming soon – insights and forecasts will be updated as analysis progresses.
